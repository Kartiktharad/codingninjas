Its Gary's birthday today and he has ordered his favourite square cake consisting of '0's and '1's . But Gary wants the biggest piece of '1's and no '0's . A piece of cake is defined as a part which consist of only '1's, and all '1's share an edge with eachother on the cake. Given the size of cake N and the cake , can you find the size of the biggest piece of '1's for Gary ?
Constraints :
1<=N<=50
Input Format :
Line 1 : An integer N denoting the size of cake
Next N lines : N characters denoting the cake
Output Format :
Size of the biggest piece of '1's and no '0's
Sample Input :
2
11
01
Sample Output :
3
