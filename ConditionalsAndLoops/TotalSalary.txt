Total Salary

Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. The user has to enter the basic salary (an integer) and the grade (an uppercase character), and depending upon which the total salary is calculated as -
    totalSalary = basic + hra + da + allow – pf
where :
hra   = 20% of basic
da    = 50% of basic
allow = 1700 if grade = ‘A’
allow = 1500 if grade = ‘B’
allow = 1300 if grade = ‘C' or any other character
pf    = 11% of basic.
Round off the total salary and then print the integral part only.
Input format :
Basic salary & Grade (separated by space)
Output Format :
Total Salary
Sample Input 1 :
10000 A
Sample Output 1 :
17600
Sample Input 2 :
4567 B
Sample Output 2 :
8762

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// Write your code here
	int basic,totals=0,allow;
    char c;
    cin>>basic>>c;
    if(c=='A')
        allow=1700;
    else if(c=='B')
        allow=1500;
    else
        allow=1300;
    totals=1.59*(basic+0.4)+allow;
    cout<<totals;
    return 0;
